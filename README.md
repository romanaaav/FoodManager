# FoodManager
  Simple desktop application made to test the graphical capabilities of the almost deprecated Swing Library in Java.
This basic desktop application is cappable of making ingredients out of forms made with the Swing Library, as well
as grouping them in recipes. All the functionality is divided by panels.

# Design
  The graphical user interface was made only by components of the Swing library mostly on their default configurations, looks and feels.
The 'entities' package contains the models of the ingredients and recipes, that are the main data structures to handle in the application.
The application was designed by basic fundamentals of Object Oriented programming, this implementation uses several features 
added in Java 8 such as functional expressions and Lambda Functions.

  This project was made with the Gradle Build Tool, using NetBeans IDE(NetBeans IDE contains a very intuitive GUI Builder),
in the current state there's no need of a dependency manager like Gradle, but will be useful in future versions
to implement connection to databases and web servers.
